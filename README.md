# üìù API - Local Storage - Git Inspired - Project 1

This app allows you to find GitHub repos by searching for specific GitHub users. If you don't know any by memory, you can find repositories by coding language. When you get very overwhelmed by the extensive amount of code out there, just GIT INSPIRED by the random quote of the day at the bottom of the page. And if you feel like sharing your inspiration with the world, go ahead and tweet your new findings. 

# Description

USER STORY: 
As a coder, I want to visit the website and input a github username I am presented a list of their repositories. 
If I am interested in finding repositories by HTML, JAvascript, or CSS, I can pick the language button and see  repositories about them. 
When I get overwhelmed, I just look at the Random quote at the bottom and find joy in life again. 
If I want to share with the world, I click on the tweeter button and share from my own account. 

# Technology used

# Project Requirements

* Use a Framework other than Bootstrap- I used BULMA.
